# Utilibot

JavaScript-based modular Discord bot. Nothing much more than that. This is a template to build your own. Built for any platform that supports the screen command.

# Usage

Add the module files anywhere you feel like. Add their name, abreviated name, and file location to ``modules.json``. This file gets read at boot and is continuously modified. Make sure it is in the same directory as ``modman.js``.
